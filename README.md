# PMAAS Environment Plugin

A plugin that wraps lower-level environmental sensors and controllers
and provides additional functionality and a user interface.

The idea is to re-use the same interface for multiple sensors.

## Notes

- Tracks daily highs and lows.
- Provides a single entity type over multiple lower-level types.
